Loops

While using some conditional

for using either range or without using range and over some iterable item

Nested loop, all these three kinds of loops can be used inside
one another, and this structure is referred to as nested loops/iterations

Loop control statements: break, continue and pass

range(start, stop, step):
start: it is optional and default value is 0
end: position to stop (non-inclusive) and mandatory
step: steps to take

In-built functions:

print() - prints arguments on the console
input() - takes input from the console as a string
type() - returns the type of an object
len() - returns the length of an object
max() - return the largest value in the iterable
min() - reuturn the smallest value in the iterable
sum() - sums the elements in an iterator
sorted() - returns the sorted list
iter() - returns an iterator object
next() - returns the next element in the iterator object
enumerate() - enumerates by adding counter to an iterable
zip() -  returns an iterator after coupling two or more iterator
map() - returns the iterator after applying specific function on each element in it
filter() - returns an iterator after applying specific filtering function

Collections in python

List, Tuple, Dictionary, Set

(note that Dictionaries have been modified to maintain insertion order with the release of Python 3.7, so they are now ordered collection of data values.)

in the sequence shown above
Notation: [],(),{'key':'value'},{}
creation: list(), tuple(), dict(),set()
mutability: only tuple is immutable, i.e. cannot be modified once assigned
types of elements: Any, Any, keys: Hashable values: any, Hashable
order: expect set all are ordered in python 3.7 and above
duplicate: duplicate keys not allowed in dictionary, duplicates not allowed in set
operations: list: add/update/delete, tuples: no operations, dict; keys: add/del ; values: add/update/del, sets: add/del
Operations: list: index/slice/iterate, tuple: index/slice/iterate, dict: iteration, set: iteration
sorting: not possible in tuples and sets


NOTE on Hashable:
(keys canâ€™t be repeated and must be immutable and hashable,
mapping in dictionaries is based on key lookup

An object is hashable if it has a hash value which never changes during its lifetime
object.__hash__() can be used to access hash values

list not hashable, but tuples are if each element within the tuple is hashable, hashable tuple can be used as a dictionary key

{(1,2,3): [10,20,30]} valid, {(1,[2]): [10,20,30]} invalid)

File handling

f = open(filename,mode)

example: s = open('crazy.txt','r')

modes:
Create 'x' - creates the file, returns error if file exists
Read 'r' - opens for reading, error if file does not exist
Append 'a' - opens a file for appending, Creates if it does not exist
Write 'w' - opens for writing, creates if it does not exist
Text 't' - default value, Text mode
Binary 'b' - Binary mode (eg images)

examples:


>>> f = open('C:\myfile.txt','a') #appending
>>> f.write(" World!")
7
>>> f.close()

# reading file
>>> f = open('C:\myfile.txt','r') 
>>> f.read()
'Hello World!'
>>> f.close()


writing of multiple lines
>>> lines=["Good bye, World!.\n", "Welcome to the Apocalipse.\n"]
>>> f=open("D:\myfile.txt", "w")
>>> f.writelines(lines)
>>> f.close()

'''

'''
Reading a file:

f.read(): #or whatever vairalbe you assigned the file to
reads the specified no.of bytes from the file, defalut value -1 which means entire file

f.readline():
reads file one line at a time, each exectuion goes to the next line, end will be a blank string ''

f.readlines: 
reads entire file as list of strings representing individual lines

Writing to a file:

f.write():
file must be opened in 'w' or 'a' mode in order to write

f.close():
important to close the file after necessary operations, can be included in the finally block as a good programming practice

OOB - Object Oriented Programming

Python is an OOB, i.e. each and every entity in Python is an object with associated attributes

Creating a class:
class myClass: #basic structure with no attributes
    def __init__(self):
        pass

Creating an object:

obj = myClass() #object of class defined above with no attributes
'''

#example class from lecture with attribures, methods etc
class Student(): #initiation of class Student
    count = 0 #class variable
    def __init__(self, roll_no, name, total): #attibutes
        self.roll_no = roll_no #object variable
        self.name = name
        self.total = total
    
    def display(self): #methods of the class
        print(self.roll_no, self.name, self.total) #simple print

'''
Ineritence:
to inherit attributes or methods from a parent class

Types:
Simple inheritance - one parent one child
Hierarchical inheritance - one parent multiple children
Multiple inheritance - multiple parents one child
Multilevel inheritance Parent -> Intermediate (acts as child for parent and parent for child) -> Child 
(or Grandparent -> Parent -> Child)
Hybrid inheritance any combos of above four

Note: adding two underscores before a variable/attribute makes it private and can only be accessed within that class/method

Method Overloading (python doesn't support overloading):
->More than one method of a class sharing same method name with different attributes
->Used to add more to the behavior of mehtods
->Python doesn't support overloading and uses the last defined method by default
->example of Compile time polymorphism

Method Overriding:
-> example of Run time polymorphism
-> specific implementation of a method that is already defined in the parent class
-> used to change behavoir of existing methods
-> inheritance is a must for overriding since it is done between Parent (super class) and child (child class) methods

'''
#exmple of Hierarchical inheritance shown below

class Person: #Parent class or base calss, with or without paranthesis is ok
    def __init__(self, name, age):
        self.name = name
        self.age = age
        #self.__age = age #, adding underscores makes it a private variable and children cannot access
    
    def display(self):
        print(self.name, self.age, end = ' ')

class Student(Person): #child or derived or sub class
    def __init__(self, name, age, marks):
